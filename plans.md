# Game Concept: "AGI Deployment Simulator 2028"

## Objective
Simulate the deployment of AGI across the USA, allowing the player to select locations and industries to invest in, and observe the impact over time.

## Game Interface
1. **Map of the USA:**
   - A detailed, interactive map displaying major cities.
   - Cities can be clicked to select for AGI deployment.

2. **Control Panel:**
   - Options to choose which industry to invest in for each city (e.g., healthcare, transportation, education, finance).
   - Display of the current date and time progression controls (e.g., play, pause, fast-forward).

3. **Information Display:**
   - A dashboard showing the current status of AGI deployment.
   - Metrics such as economic growth, public approval, technological advancements, and social impacts.

4. **Event Log:**
   - A log of decisions made and their consequences over time.
   - Notifications of significant events and developments resulting from AGI deployment.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Starting the Game
- The player begins with a limited budget and a few AGI units to deploy.
- Introduction to the game's storyline and objectives through a cutscene or tutorial.

### Deploying AGI
- Click on a city to open a menu of industries.
- Select an industry to deploy AGI in, making strategic decisions based on the city's needs and potential impact.

### Time Progression
- After each deployment decision, time advances quickly.
- The player can control the speed of time progression to observe the impacts of their decisions.

### Observing Impact
- Each decision affects various metrics, which are updated in real-time.
- Detailed feedback on how AGI deployment has influenced the selected city and industry.

### Events and Challenges
- Random events and challenges that the player must respond to, such as public protests, technological breakthroughs, or economic shifts.
- Decisions during these events can have positive or negative consequences.

### Progression
- As the player successfully manages AGI deployment, they earn more budget and resources to expand their efforts.
- Unlock new technologies and AGI capabilities to further enhance the impact.

## Example Scenario

### Step 1: Selecting a City
- The player clicks on New York City on the map.

### Step 2: Choosing an Industry
- A menu pops up with options: Healthcare, Transportation, Education, Finance.
- The player selects Healthcare.

### Step 3: Deploying AGI
- The player assigns a portion of their budget and AGI units to improve healthcare in NYC.
- A confirmation screen shows the expected impacts and costs.

### Step 4: Time Progression
- Time fast-forwards, showing changes in healthcare quality, public health statistics, and economic factors in NYC.

### Step 5: Observing Results
- The dashboard updates with new data: improved healthcare ratings, increased public approval, potential increase in taxes.
- The event log records the deployment and its initial outcomes.

### Step 6: Facing Challenges
- A random event occurs: a healthcare crisis in another city, requiring a strategic decision on whether to divert resources.

## Additional Features

1. **Research and Development:**
   - Invest in R&D to unlock new AGI capabilities and enhancements.
   - Research can provide bonuses and new opportunities for deployment.

2. **Public Relations:**
   - Manage public opinion through media campaigns and transparency.
   - Address public concerns and ethical dilemmas regarding AGI.

3. **Economic Management:**
   - Balance the budget and manage resources to ensure sustainable growth.
   - Economic decisions affect the player's ability to deploy AGI effectively.

4. **Long-Term Goals:**
   - Set and achieve long-term goals such as nationwide healthcare improvement, economic prosperity, or technological dominance.

## Technical Implementation

### Project Setup
- Create a new React/TypeScript project.
- Set up routing and state management (e.g., using React Router and Redux).

### Map Component
- Integrate a map library (e.g., Leaflet, Mapbox) to display and interact with the USA map.
- Implement clickable cities and dynamic tooltips showing city information.

### Control Panel and Dashboard
- Develop UI components for industry selection, time control, and data display.
- Implement state management to track and update game metrics.

### Event Handling
- Create a system to generate and manage random events and challenges.
- Implement decision-making interfaces for the player to respond to events.

### Feedback and Metrics
- Set up data visualization tools (e.g., charts, graphs) to display metrics and impacts.
- Implement a logging system to record and display the event log.

Would you like to start with setting up the project structure and creating the initial components for the map and control panel? Or is there another specific aspect you'd like to focus on first?
